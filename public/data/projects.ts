    Title: "Smart Garage System",
    Description:
      "This project is a smart garage door automation system built using Arduino and an ultrasonic sensor. When a car approaches the garage within a certain distance, the ultrasonic sensor detects its presence. The Arduino then activates a servo motor or motor driver to open the garage door. After a short delay (allowing the car to enter), the door automatically closes.This system increases convenience, enhances security, and reduces manual effort, making it ideal for smart home applications.",
